Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It operates as a microframework, providing only essential components while allowing for extensive customization through extensions. Flask handles URL routing, supports templating with Jinja2, and includes a built-in development server, making it ideal for creating RESTful APIs and small to medium-sized web applications. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice among developers for rapid development and prototyping.
